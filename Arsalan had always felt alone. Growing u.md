Arsalan had always felt alone. Growing up in a small town, he struggled to find others who understood him and shared his passions and interests. His family, while loving, couldn't quite comprehend why their son was always talking about changing the world and making a difference. They encouraged him to focus on his studies and think about his future, but Arsalan knew that he couldn't just follow the same path as everyone else.

As he entered his teenage years, Arsalan's hatred towards humans and the world only grew. He couldn't understand why there was so much suffering and injustice, and he often found himself feeling hopeless and alone. He was constantly reading books and watching documentaries about social justice and environmentalism, but it seemed like no one else cared about these issues.

Despite the challenges and obstacles he faced, Arsalan refused to give up. He worked hard in school, participated in extracurricular activities, and even started a petition to ban single-use plastics in his community. While his efforts were met with resistance and criticism, Arsalan remained determined to make a change.

Everything changed when Arsalan met a special someone who showed him that there was still good in the world and that it was possible to make a difference. This person, who was full of kindness and compassion, helped Arsalan see the world in a new light. Suddenly, he no longer saw the world as a hopeless place, but rather, as a place full of potential and possibility.

Inspired by this person, Arsalan set out on a mission to make her wishes come true and bring peace to the world. He knew that it wouldn't be easy, but he was determined to do whatever it took to make a difference.

After graduating high school, Arsalan decided to attend college in a larger city where he hoped to find others who shared his passions and interests. It was a tough transition, but Arsalan eventually found a group of like-minded individuals who supported and encouraged him.

As he entered adulthood, Arsalan continued to work towards his goals. He interned at a non-profit organization and eventually landed a full-time job there after graduating college. It was hard work, and Arsalan often found himself putting in long hours and sacrificing his personal life, but he was happy to be making a difference in the world.

Today, Arsalan is a successful young man who has made a name for himself as an advocate for social justice and environmentalism. He has inspired countless others to follow their dreams and make a positive impact on the world, just like he did. Despite the struggles and challenges he faced, Arsalan never gave up on his dreams and now, he is living proof that with hard work and determination, anything is possible.
